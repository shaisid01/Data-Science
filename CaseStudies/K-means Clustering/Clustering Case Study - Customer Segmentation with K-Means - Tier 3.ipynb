    "How do we visualize clusters? If we only had two features, we could likely plot the data as is. But we have 100 data points each containing 32 features (dimensions). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will help us reduce the dimensionality of our data from 32 to something lower. For a visualization on the coordinate plane, we will use 2 dimensions. In this exercise, we're going to use it to transform our multi-dimensional dataset into a 2 dimensional dataset.\n",

PCA is also used to reduce a large set of variables into a much smaller one.\n",

    "* **Affinity Propagation** does not require the number of clusters $K$ to be known in advance! AP uses a \"message passing\" paradigm to cluster points based on their similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spectral Clustering** uses the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the data before clustering in a lower dimensional space. This is tangentially similar to what we did to visualize k-means clusters using PCA. The number of clusters must be known a priori.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ward's Method** applies to hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering algorithms take a set of data and successively divide the observations into more and more clusters at each layer of the hierarchy. Ward's method is used to determine when two clusters in the hierarchy should be combined into one. It is basically an extension of hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering is *divisive*, that is, all observations are part of the same cluster at first, and at each successive iteration, the clusters are made smaller and smaller. With hierarchical clustering, a hierarchy is constructed, and there is not really the concept of \"number of clusters.\" The number of clusters simply determines how low or how high in the hierarchy we reference and can be determined empirically or by looking at the [dendogram](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agglomerative Clustering** is similar to hierarchical clustering but but is not divisive, it is *agglomerative*. That is, every observation is placed into its own cluster and at each iteration or level or the hierarchy, observations are merged into fewer and fewer clusters until convergence. Similar to hierarchical clustering, the constructed hierarchy contains all possible numbers of clusters and it is up to the analyst to pick the number by reviewing statistics or the dendogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DBSCAN** is based on point density rather than distance. It groups together points with many nearby neighbors. DBSCAN is one of the most cited algorithms in the literature. It does not require knowing the number of clusters a priori, but does require specifying the neighborhood size."
